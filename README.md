### Java Classes and Objects

#### Create a Class

To create a class, use the keyword `class`:

```java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}
```

Remember from the [Java Syntax chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_syntax.asp) that a class should always start with an uppercase first letter, and that the name of the java file should match the class name.

### Create an Object

Create an object called "`myObj`" and print the value of x:

```java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
```

### Java Constructors

A constructor in Java is a **special method** that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:

```java
// Create a Main class
public class Main {
  int x;  // Create a class attribute

  // Create a class constructor for the Main class
  public Main() {
    x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of class Main (This will call the constructor)
    System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
  }
}

// Outputs 5
```

Note that the constructor name must **match the class name**, and it cannot have a **return type** (like `void`).

Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.

All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

#### Constructor Parameters

Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.

The following example adds an `int y` parameter to the constructor. Inside the constructor we set x to y (x=y). When we call the constructor, we pass a parameter to the constructor (5), which will set the value of x to 5:

```java
public class Main {
  int x;

  public Main(int y) {
    x = y;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main(5);
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

// Outputs 5
```

#### Modifiers

We divide modifiers into two groups:

- **Access Modifiers** - controls the access level
- **Non-Access Modifiers** - do not control access level, but provides other functionality

##### Access Modifiers

| **Modifier** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| public       | The class is accessible by any other class                   |
| *default*    | The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the [Packages chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_packages.asp) |

For **attributes, methods and constructors**, you can use the one of the following:

| **Modifier** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| public       | The code is accessible for all classes                       |
| private      | The code is only accessible within the declared class        |
| *default*    | The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the [Packages chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_packages.asp) |
| protected    | The code is accessible in the same package and **subclasses**. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses in the [Inheritance chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp) |

##### Non-Access Modifiers

For **classes**, you can use either `final` or `abstract`:

| Modifier | **Description**                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| final    | The class cannot be inherited by other classes (You will learn more about inheritance in the [Inheritance chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp)) |
| abstract | The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. You will learn more about inheritance and abstraction in the [Inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp) and [Abstraction](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_abstract.asp) chapters) |

For **attributes and methods**, you can use the one of the following:

| **Modifier** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| final        | Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified         |
| static       | Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object |
| abstract     | Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body, for example **abstract void run();**. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from). You will learn more about inheritance and abstraction in the [Inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp) and [Abstraction](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_abstract.asp) chapters |
| transient    | Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them |
| synchronized | Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time         |
| volatile     | The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory" |

Example: final

If you don't want the ability to override existing attribute values, declare attributes as `final`:

```java
public class Main {
  final int x = 10;
  final double PI = 3.14;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    myObj.x = 50; // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
    myObj.PI = 25; // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
```

Example: static

A `static` method means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike `public`:

```java
public class Main {
  // Static method
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }

  // Main method
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method
    // myPublicMethod(); This would output an error

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method
  }
}
```

#### Abstract

An `abstract` method belongs to an `abstract` class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass:

```java
// Code from filename: Main.java
abstract classabstract class Main {
  public String fname = "John";
  public int age = 24;
  public abstract void study(); // abstract method
}

// Subclass (inherit from Main)
class Student extends Main {
  public int graduationYear = 2018;
  public void study() { // the body of the abstract method is provided here
    System.out.println("Studying all day long");
  }
}
// End code from filename: Main.java

// Code from filename: Second.java
class Second {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // create an object of the Student class (which inherits attributes and methods from Main)
    Student myObj = new Student();

    System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.fname);
    System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.age);
    System.out.println("Graduation Year: " + myObj.graduationYear);
    myObj.study(); // call abstract method  }
}
```

### Java Class Attributes

class attributes are variables within a class:

```java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 3;
}
```

#### Java Class Methods

You learned from the [Java Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp) chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:

```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

##### Static vs. Non-Static

In the example above, we created a `static` method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike `public`, which can only be accessed by objects:

An example to demonstrate the differences between `static` and `public` **methods**:

```java
public class Main {
  // Static method
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }

  // Main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method
    // myPublicMethod(); This would compile an error

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method on the object
  }
}
```

##### Method Overloading

With **method overloading**, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters:

```java
int myMethod(int x)
float myMethod(float x)
double myMethod(double x, double y)
```

consider the following example, which has two methods that add numbers of different type:

```csharp
static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y) {
  return x + y;
}

static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {
  return x + y;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  int myNum1 = plusMethodInt(8, 5);
  double myNum2 = plusMethodDouble(4.3, 6.26);
  System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);
  System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);
}
```

**Note:** Multiple methods can have the same name as long as the number and/or type of parameters are different.
