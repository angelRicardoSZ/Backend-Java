### Java Classes and Objects

#### Create a Class

To create a class, use the keyword `class`:

```java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}
```

Remember from the [Java Syntax chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_syntax.asp) that a class should always start with an uppercase first letter, and that the name of the java file should match the class name.

### Create an Object

Create an object called "`myObj`" and print the value of x:

```java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
```

### Java Constructors

A constructor in Java is a **special method** that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:

```java
// Create a Main class
public class Main {
  int x;  // Create a class attribute

  // Create a class constructor for the Main class
  public Main() {
    x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of class Main (This will call the constructor)
    System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
  }
}

// Outputs 5
```

Note that the constructor name must **match the class name**, and it cannot have a **return type** (like `void`).

Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.

All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

#### Constructor Parameters

Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.

The following example adds an `int y` parameter to the constructor. Inside the constructor we set x to y (x=y). When we call the constructor, we pass a parameter to the constructor (5), which will set the value of x to 5:

```java
public class Main {
  int x;

  public Main(int y) {
    x = y;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main(5);
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

// Outputs 5
```

### Java Class Attributes

class attributes are variables within a class:

```java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 3;
}
```

#### Java Class Methods

You learned from the [Java Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp) chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:

```java
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

##### Static vs. Non-Static

In the example above, we created a `static` method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike `public`, which can only be accessed by objects:

An example to demonstrate the differences between `static` and `public` **methods**:

```java
public class Main {
  // Static method
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }

  // Main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method
    // myPublicMethod(); This would compile an error

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method on the object
  }
}
```
